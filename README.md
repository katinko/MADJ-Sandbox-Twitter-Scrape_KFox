Twitter Scrape of Trending Hashtag for Digital Sandbox Assignment #2

The aim of this assignment was to gather data over time from twitter of #CharlieHebdo and #JeSuisCharlie and then     
display that data in the form of a time series chart in an HTML web page.
To create your own, get the consumer keys and key tokens from the twitter developer API 
and use your own hashtags to scrape a trending hashtag of your choice: https://apps.twitter.com/
